	    <h1>How to Embed a Service-Hosted Video</h1>
	    <p>Embedding a video from a third-party platform, such as YouTube or Vimeo, is very simple. You can see step-by-step directions below, with an example video from YouTube.</p>
		<ol type="1">
			<li>Once you have chosen the video you would like to embed, take a look around it for a "Share" button. On YouTube, this should be right below the video.<br/><img src="Documents/embed1.jpg" alt="Step One Example"/></li>
			<li>Clicking this button should bring up a menu with share options. Look for an option that says "Embed".<br/><img src="Documents/embed2.jpg" alt="Step Two Example"/></li>
			<li>The "Embed" button will pull up a window that shows you the code for the video and will allow you to make minor adjustments to how you want it to appear. You can then select "Copy" and paste the code to your html document.<br/><img src="Documents/embed3.jpg" alt="Step Three Example"/></li>
