		<h1>Unique Opportunity for Aspiring Photographers</h1>
		<h2>The Start</h2>
		<p>
		Eliza Fonseca has been a dedicated photographer for nearly a 
		decade. She started her own business in 2016 with a goal to provide 
		quality photos to families in the greater Pittsburgh area. She has 
		built a community of clients that have supported her over the years 
		and will continue to do so. Here is a recent review from a loyal client:
			<blockquote>
			Eliza is wonderful! Her pictures are beautiful, and she is 
			such a friendly and sweet person to work with. She has captured all of 
			our daughter’s sweetest moments in her first year of life, and we can’t 
			wait for future sessions!

			</blockquote>
		</p>
		<h2>The Reason</h2>
		<p>
		Fonseca has expressed interest in supporting her fellow entrepreneurs. 
		In a recent blog post shared on her website, Photos by Fonseca, Eliza 
		detailed her plan to invite beginner photographers to grow their own 
		experience by shadowing her sessions. As an entrepreneur herself, Eliza 
		understands how hard it can be to grow a business alone. In her post, 
		she shared her 
			<q>passion for helping other aspiring photographers.</q>
		</p>
		<h2>The Plan</h2>
		<p>
		Beginning September 19th, Eliza will be accepting applications to join 
		her trial classes. She will be providing 15 aspiring photographers with 
		the opportunity to learn the ropes by shadowing a session and taking 
		pictures of their own. Following the session, participants will be 
		encouraged to enter a friendly competition for the chance to win their 
		very own Canon R8.<br/>
